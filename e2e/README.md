## Test Structure

- `editor.spec.js` - Basic editor functionality tests
  - Loading and initialization
  - Text input
  - Markdown triggers (e.g., `# ` for headings)
  - Block creation
  - Formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
  - Conversion to markdown/HTML

## Writing New Tests

Create new spec files in this directory following the pattern:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test('should do something', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    // Your test code
  });
});
```

## Playwright MCP Integration

## CI/CD

Tests are configured to:
- Run with retries in CI environments
- Use a single worker in CI
- Start the dev server automatically before tests
